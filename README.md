# A demo of what `preload` can do
* Normal webpage without `preload`
    * localhost:3000/1
* Webpage that uses `preload` for Google fonts
    * localhost:3000/2
* Webpage that uses `response headers` to preload Google fonts. Notice how the HTML page does not use the `preload` tag itself
    * localhost:3000/3
* Webpage that preloads different images based on media queries.
    * localhost:3000/4
